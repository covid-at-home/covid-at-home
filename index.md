This website started as a way to share our early research regarding the COVID-19 pandemic. We were trying to write down for ourselves and our friends what to do when so many people were going to get sick. Much of what's discussed here may be common sense to some, but we felt it's still good to have some checklists and advice for various stages of illness in one place. We consulted with nurses and doctors, but this site was created by the non-medically trained, trying to puzzle together what makes sense in our new normal.

As we started writing for this site in Berlin, Germany in the second week of March 2020, much about the virus was still unclear, but numbers of infected and dead were rising steadily, most recently in Italy. Whether the virus has caused total crisis where you are or not: It is time to think and prepare.

This guide is based on the assumption that in the coming months, more people than usual will either become ill or have ill people in their lives. Let's all hope for the best, but we're going to assume that doctors and hospitals are going to be very busy if not overloaded. We have to confront the possibility that some of the people who would normally be cared for under medical supervision might need to be cared for at home. We hope some of the information here will give you some confidence in dealing with this disease, which in and by itself will reduce the load on doctors and nurses who, from the looks of it, will be quite busy in weeks and months to come. At the same time, we hope to give you information that helps you tell when it is time to get professional medical help. Getting large amounts of people to get that balance right may make all the difference in the time to come.

### What this guide is not...

We try to provide a large amount of *general* helpful tips for dealing with COVID-19 during the various stages in which it might affect your household. **What we cannot do is provide up-to-date information that is specific to where you are.** We will try to tell you when we think you need to seek up-to-date local information in text boxes such as this.

Note that any advice from official sources you may find could be outdated as soon as a few days after it is issued, so always try to find the latest guidance and advice you can. Refer to local broadcast media and **trusted** information on the internet. Your local health authorities know the situation on the ground where you are, and should be talking to the public through the media.

That said, we are seeing various levels of quality in official response. Sometimes there will insufficient capacity to supply everyone with individual help and advice, for example because hotlines and testing centers are overloaded. **Help may well be unavailable at some times**. In this text we will just keep going, giving you the best advice we found in our research. This doesn't mean we think such general advice as is on this site could be better than local help from trained professionals. Treat the advanced chapters of this website as a last resort: much better than nothing, but by all means get local help from actual professionals if you can.

Also note that **we do not sugar-coat**. This site is written by and for adults who can handle thinking through the consequences of our current global predicament. There is no reason to panic, but the situation is serious enough that we feel everyone should have access to the best information we could find.

### Know the Facts: 

* COVID-19 is real. 
* Itâ€™s a disease caused by the new SARS-CoV-2 virus that mutated to infect human hosts after starting in animals.
* COVID-19 is dangerous. 
  * The virus that causes it seems to spread far [more readily than SARS](https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-020-00660-x). 
  * It seems to commonly cause pneumonia, while most cases of the seasonal influenza virus (flu) [do not](https://www.lung.org/lung-health-diseases/lung-disease-lookup/pneumonia/what-is-the-connection) (and those that do are more dangerous). COVID-19 is also associated with far more other, serious complications requiring medical care, such as acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), cardiac events (especially in people with existing heart disease), respiratory failure, septic shock, liver injury, and multi-organ failure. It seems to cause [over 3x](https://www.who.int/dg/speeches/detail/who-director-general-s-opening-remarks-at-the-media-briefing-on-covid-19---3-march-2020) and possibly [10x more deaths](https://www.reuters.com/video/watch/idOVC4M5QSF) than the flu. (But until testing is much more widespread, it will be impossible to know for sure.) 
  * Unlike the flu and other diseases, there are currently no known vaccines or anti-viral treatments for COVID-19 supported by sufficient scientific evidence from double-blind, randomized controlled trials. (Though you can be sure research is ongoing worldwide!) 
  * It's also worse than the flu because the world population so far lacks immunity. New pathogens are more potentially dangerous, because their infection rates can grow incredibly rapidly (even having [exponential growth](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O133ppiVnWY)). Such rapid transmission of a new pathogen that commonly causes disease severe enough to require medical care can swiftly overwhelm even the world's best healthcare systems, making it impossible for everyone who needs care (including for unrelated conditions) to access it -- and in turn contributing to even more severe disease and more, otherwise avoidable deaths. 
* Slowing the spread of COVID-19 down (also known as mitigation){{site.footnote.begin}}You may have heard the phrase "flatten the curve" in this context. This refers to the idea that after containment of a new disease-causing pathogen has failed and a global pandemic is on (like now), the best we can do is to mitigate -- trying to flatten the curve (lower the incidence and slow the pace) of new cases requiring medical care so that it stays [within the capacity](https://www.nytimes.com/article/flatten-curve-coronavirus.html) of the medical system. This should [decrease deaths and buy us time](https://medium.com/@tomaspueyo/coronavirus-act-today-or-people-will-die-f4d3d9cd99ca) to better prepare -- making more respirators / masks and other personal protective equipment, ventilators and retrained medical professionals, and maybe even treatments or vaccines for the disease.<br> Some critics argue that what we actually want from mitigation measures, however, is really still to stop the spread -- and get back to containment. Because when they put feasible numbers on the curves, they find that we would have to "flatten the curve" -- spread the pandemic out -- for [more than a decade](https://medium.com/@joschabach/flattening-the-curve-is-a-deadly-delusion-eea324fe9727) in order to stay within the capacity of the medical system. Some epidemiologists think that once containment has failed with a novel, easily transmissible respiratory virus like this one in the modern world, we can't turn back the clock and have it work as a strategy again. In that case, then using mitigation measures for mitigation's sake makes sense. Then one might still say the goal is to flatten the curve -- just not to below the medical system's capacity like it is usually pictured in the media these days, since that doesn't seem to be possible without mitigation leading us back to containment. It is not currently possible to resolve the question of whether we can or cannot get back to containment of COVID-19, because this is a fast-evolving situation involving a new pathogen, and we do not know enough yet about its [infectious period, transmissibility, clinical severity, and extent of community spread](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32145768).<br>
Anyway, due to this controversy, we avoid using the phrase "flatten the curve" (which may not work for its intended purpose of keeping the pandemic within medical systems' capacities) in favor of "mitigation" and "slowing the spread" (which should still work to save lives and buy time even if medical systems get overwhelmed.{{site.footnote.end}} is the best chance we still have to save a large number of lives. Slowing the spread down requires widespread cooperation with and implementation of measures like accessible testing, isolation for the sick and those exposed to them, and social distancing -- sometimes even rising to the level of sheltering in place -- for everyone else (see Level 1 below).  
* For these reasons, many have changed or will soon need to change their way of life to address the very real threat this pandemic poses to everyone on Planet Earth. 

Remember that there is no difference in potential infectiousness between friends and strangers. There is no race, ethnic group, or nationality that is innately more likely to get or transmit the virus than another. Try to help others when you can without being in physical contact with other people unnecessarily: A lot will depend on whether the social fabric of our society holds. Slowing the spread of an infectious disease is rarely absolute. But taken over society as a whole, our efforts still work when everyone does what they can, within their limits.

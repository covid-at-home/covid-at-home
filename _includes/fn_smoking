People may have seen [this article](https://www.qeios.com/read/article/561) claiming to show that smokers were less likely to be hospitalized with COVID-19 in China, and thus quitting smoking should not be recommended to lower that risk. However, there are several problems with its logic and methodology, including failure to acknowledge relevant biases:<br>
1. Current smokers with COVID-19 are probably likelier than non-smokers to have lung and cardiovascular problems that put them at heightened risk for more severe COVID-19 to the extent that they are at greater risk of dying in their homes. Data from several countries suggests COVID-19 deaths are probably being greatly undercounted due to undiagnosed people dying at home. This article only looks at hospitalizations, and so misses this probably large number of deaths in homes.<br> 
2. There is a well-established "teetotaler bias" in which people with more health problems seem to be more likely to quit drinking altogether than to continue drinking moderately. This makes tetotaling look risky in terms of health outcomes, until you account for the fact that it is sicker people who tend to quit drinking to begin with. Smoking could work the same way here, so that non-smokers appear more likely to end up hospitalized with COVID-19 than their prevalence in the Chinese general population would suggest. But part of what is really going on is probably that people who are sicker are more likely to quit smoking and more likely to then be hospitalized with COVID-19. The article fails to account for this previous ill health bias.<br>
3. Smoking in China skews rural, so a lower than expected smoking rate in hospitalized city Chinese COVID-19 patients would be expected. The article fails to account for this rural-urban bias in Chinese smoking rates. <br>
Smoking is a risk factor for the sorts of health problems that are risk factors for more severe COVID-19. Moreover, another [systematic review](http://www.tobaccoinduceddiseases.org/COVID-19-and-smoking-A-systematic-review-of-the-evidence,119324,0,2.html) found: "although further research is warranted as the weight of the evidence increases, with the limited available data, and although the above results are unadjusted for other factors that may impact disease progression, smoking is most likely associated with the negative progression and adverse outcomes of COVID-19." The authors of the contrarian smoking article cite this previous review article, but do not try to account for the discrepancy between its findings and their own.<br>
Overall, the evidence that quitting smoking is a particularly good idea in the context of the current global pandemic is sufficient for public health experts to continue recommending it.

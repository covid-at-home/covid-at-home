People may have seen [this article](https://www.qeios.com/read/article/561) claiming to show that smokers were less likely to be hospitalized with COVID-19 in China, and thus quitting smoking should not be recommended to lower that risk. However, there are several problems with its logic and methodology, including failure to acknowledge relevant biases:<br>
1. Current smokers with COVID-19 are probably likelier than non-smokers to have lung and cardiovascular problems that put them at heightened risk for more severe COVID-19 to the extent that they are at greater risk of dying in their homes. This article only looks at hospitalizations, missing deaths at home.<br> 
2. Smokers with worse health may be more likely to quit smoking. This would make quitting look risky in terms of health outcomes, until you account for the fact that it is sicker people who tend to quit smoking.<br>
3. Smoking in China skews rural, so a lower than expected smoking rate in hospitalized city Chinese COVID-19 patients would reflect this.<br>
Smoking is a risk factor for the sorts of health problems that are risk factors for more severe COVID-19. Moreover, another [systematic review](http://www.tobaccoinduceddiseases.org/COVID-19-and-smoking-A-systematic-review-of-the-evidence,119324,0,2.html) found: "although further research is warranted as the weight of the evidence increases, with the limited available data, and although the above results are unadjusted for other factors that may impact disease progression, smoking is most likely associated with the negative progression and adverse outcomes of COVID-19." The authors of the contrarian smoking article cite this previous review article, but do not offer any possible account for the discrepancy between its findings and their own.<br>
Overall, the evidence that quitting smoking is a particularly good idea in the context of the current global pandemic is sufficient for public health experts to continue recommending it.

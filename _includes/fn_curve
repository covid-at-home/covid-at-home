You may have also heard mitigation or slowing the spread called "flattening the curve." But that phrase now usually refers to slowing the pace of new cases requiring medical care so that they stay [within the capacity](https://www.nytimes.com/article/flatten-curve-coronavirus.html) of the medical system. Critics argue we would have to "flatten the curve" for [more than a decade](https://medium.com/@joschabach/flattening-the-curve-is-a-deadly-delusion-eea324fe9727) in order to achieve that — which seems impossible with such a contagious virus. So what we really want, they argue, is to use mitigation to get back to containment — ultimately stopping rather than just slowing the spread.<br>
But there's not currently a scientific consensus on whether that is possible, because this is a fast-evolving situation involving a new pathogen, and we do not know enough yet about its [infectious period, transmissibility, clinical severity, and extent of community spread](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32145768). However, there is broad (but not universal) agreement among leading epidemiologists and other relevant experts that mitigation will still be effective in decreasing needless suffering and deaths, in part by flattening the curve enough to [buy us time](https://medium.com/@tomaspueyo/coronavirus-act-today-or-people-will-die-f4d3d9cd99ca) to better prepare -- making more respirators / masks and other personal protective equipment, ventilators and retrained medical professionals, and maybe even treatments or vaccines for the disease.<br>
Anyway, due to this controversy, we avoid using the phrase "flatten the curve" in the text because to most people now, it means slowing disease spread enough to keep it within medical systems' capacities (probably impossible) rather than slowing it to stop it (maybe possible) — or slowing it just to decrease the damage it does (definitely possible).

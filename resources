This is a placeholder for a resources page that may or may not be a list of links to other sites' lists of links (or is that too meta?). 

Cos we have two open issues I wanna close out on the main site pre-fork, regarding these two sites as resources: 

1. https://github.com/cwoomi/cert-covid19  (German-focused) 

2. https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019/global-research-on-novel-coronavirus-2019-ncov (research-focused)

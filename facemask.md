#### Step 2: cut out the squares

Cut two squares the size of the template, and use the scissors to make small cuts where the cut marks on the template are to mark where the folds will be.

Put the squares on top of eachother with the nice-looking printed sides facing eachother. Then stitch along the lines marked with red dotted lines in the photo. After both sides are done **turn it inside out** so the nice sides face out and the ragged edges on top and bottom are hidden.

&nbsp;

#### Step 4: Fold

Cut two strips of fabric, each 5 cm (2") wide and 90 cm (35") long. Fold each one down the middle and iron the fold. Then fold open again and fold each side to the middle and iron the folds again.

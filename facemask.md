Cut two squares the size of the template, and use the scissors to make small cuts where the cut marks on the template are to mark where the folds will be.

Put the squares on top of eachother with the nice-looking printed sides facing eachother. Then stitch along the lines marked with red dotted lines in the photo. After both sides are done **turn it inside out** so the nice sides face out and the ragged edges on top and bottom are hidden.

#### Step 4: Fold

Fold over where the first cut is and iron the fold. then fold the other way and iron the second fold. Continue until you have it like in the rightmost photo. Then put that folded stack aside.

#### Step 5: Prepare the straps

Cut two strips of fabric, each 5 cm (2") wide and 90 cm (35") long. Fold each one down the middle and iron the fold. Then fold open again and fold each side to the middle and iron the folds again. *(You can also use a ribbon, as long as it can also be boiled/ironed to sterilize.)*

#### Step 6: Attach the straps

Insert the folded mask into the fold of a strap and stitch strap and mask together. Stitch the entire length of the strap. Repeat with other strap on other side of mask.

Make sure you boil the mask or iron it very hot to sterilize it. Make a few and change your mask if it gets wet. Take off and boil/re-iron after a day's use, without touching the outside.

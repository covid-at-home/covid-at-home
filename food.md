### Food

Some people will already be familiar with all the basic information here, but other people are used to eating in restaurants a lot or buying fresh groceries every few days. This list is intended to most help people who are having to change their way of eating during this crisis due to restaurants being closed, near-daily grocery store runs being inadviseable, and other ordinary ways of getting food otherwise being unavailable. This is not a list of recipes -- there is no shortage of those on the Internet -- but rather of how to think about putting together and maintaining a pantry with healthy food you like that will last for 2-4 weeks, because having that much food on hand is part of the standard emergency preparedness advice. 

There is a bias inherent here against [ultra-processed foods](https://www.theguardian.com/food/2020/feb/13/how-ultra-processed-food-took-over-your-shopping-basket-brazil-carlos-monteiro) -- sugar, fat, starch, and additive-filled creations such as cereal bars and frozen dinners that might be especially tempting when you are feeling stressed and can't reach for your normal, healthier foods. But their intake is strongly associated with [obesity and related health problems](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5787353/). Conversely, eating whole foods instead -- like fruit, vegetables, nuts, beans, eggs, fish, and dairy products such as milk and yogurt with no sugar or other additives -- is associated with a range of better health outcomes. In addition, eating a healthier, less processed diet [significantly reduces your risk for depression](https://www.theguardian.com/food/2019/mar/18/can-you-eat-yourself-happier-nutritional-psychiatry-mental-health). 

So the very real challenge this general advice responds to is one that we all face -- to stay healthy and sane by eating a balanced diet composed of real food, when access to fresh food is a little bit more constrained than under normal conditions. Given this challenge, it probably makes sense to think about your food supplies as fitting into roughly three categories: Food lasting about one week, a few weeks longer in the fridge, or much longer in the cabinet. Of course, most people began eating their favorite shelf-stable emergency supplies (or emergency cookies) already in the first week of sheltering in place. (Testing is important!) That's fine so long as you keep topping up your emergency stores in case of, well, emergency. 

#### Fresh and perishable

Hopefully you are well, your neighborhood is not a current COVID-19 hotspot, and you have a mask and gloves, so you can still go out and buy fresh fruit, vegetables, meat, and cheese (if you eat them) about once a week. The earlier you go, the lighter the foot traffic in stores (usually). Even better, you could do this online and have the fresh food delivered -- preferably left at the door -- in order to protect yourself and others by staying at home and minimizing contact. 

#### Fresh and longer-lasting

At the same time, you might stock up on a few weeks' worth of fresh things that will keep longer than a week. Garlic and onions, potatoes and sweet potatoes / yams, citrus fruit and apples, yogurt / kefir, and some cheeses, processed breads, and meats can be good for 2-3 weeks or longer when refrigerated. Check the food packaging or reputable food safety websites (e.g., from the food safety regulatory agency in your country) if you're unsure. And if something looks or smells funny, "when in doubt, throw it out." 

#### Shelf-stable

If you are able, you might stock up even more on a few weeks' worth of canned, jarred, frozen, and otherwise shelf-stable, healthy foods that you like. Try to keep it real -- whole food ingredients when you can't stick with whole foods. That means looking for food products with no added sugar, salt, or unpronounceable additives. Here are a few tips and ideas. 

- **Produce**. Canned, jarred, dried, and frozen fruits and vegetables can have even more nutrition than fresh, when they are frozen (or whatever) shortly after harvest. There is a vast array of available shelf-stable produce. Here are some examples of things you may or may not like, and ideas of things to make with them... 
  - Condiments. Canned olives, Greek peppers, sun-dried tomatoes, and sauerkraut can be used to flavor rice, pasta, and salads. Tomato paste on toast with leftover veggies, dried herbs, and cheese can make a nice impromptu pizza. 
  - Jarred and canned fruits and vegetables. From pumpkin pie filling made with canned pumpkin to pink lemonade made with jarred, mashed cherries -- or just plain peas and carrots from a can, mixed with rice -- there are a lot of flavor, texture, and color variations to be discovered here. Canned applesauce with a sprinkling of cinnamon is a kid-friendly classic. Vegetable soups with real veggies and tomato sauce that is, well, essentially just tomatoes are also good options. 
  - Dried fruit. Dates, figs, raisins, cranberries, cherries, apricots... The list goes on. Dried fruit can sweeten up salads, corn flakes, and porridge, or give you a quick handful of healthy calories right when you need it. 
   - Bulk. Frozen broccoli and cauliflower can be steamed, chopped, and added to rice or pasta to build more fiber and water (not to mention color and flavor) into your meal. 
   - Sorbets and smoothies. If you have a blender, frozen fruit with a little tea and honey makes nice, easy sorbets. Frozen fruit with yogurt and milk or kefir makes simple smoothies. 

- **Carbohydrates**. Pasta and rice, oatmeal and other porridges, and flours tend to be extremely shelf-stable and versatile as the basis of meals. You probably want to vary them to keep your diet diverse, to avoid nutritional deficiencies and boredom -- and to vary the effort level required of you in cooking. (Baking your own bread or brownies using those flours will probably take considerably more work than, say, microwaving a packet of two-minute rice and throwing some olives and cheese on top.) 

- **Protein**. While protein comes in many flavors, it's probably a good idea to think about adding umami (meaty / hearty) tastes to your quarantine pantry with protein. Some of these tastes are vegan (think smoked almonds or nutritional yeast), while others are not. Give yourself as much variety in healthy foods as you can and desire, to support your immune system -- and your psychological well-being -- in this difficult time. 
  - Go nuts. Now is a good time to increase your intake of nuts, an excellent source of protein, fiber, and healthy fats. A handful of different types of nuts (cashews, sliced almonds, sunflower seeds...) can add a lot of texture and flavor to a simple salad. Nut butters are also nutritious, but are an easier way to pack on the pounds since it's easier to eat a lot more calories more quickly that way. Slather a bit on apples slices or celery sticks to increase the feeling of fullness. Cashews can be added to soups (to be blended) for additional creaminess. 
  - Nutritional yeast is another good vegan source of protein. It can be baked onto green chips (spinach, kale) or other veggies in for an oven roast (potatoes, eggplant), or added to soup, mash, or dip for a cheesy flavor. 
  - Beans, beans, they're good for your heart... Some people say you should always make your own from dried beans, because it's cheaper than using the canned preparations, with or without added sauces. Others say you should have both types, since "fast food" is sometimes what you want. Still others say, if you're going to eat those beans, you need to find your own apartment...   
  - Tofu and eggs tend to keep a long time, especially with proper refrigeration, but check yours for dates. Smoked tofu can be diced to add flavor and protein to salads. Plain tofu can be pan-seared and added to rice along with spices, vegetables, and condiments, or an easy jar of curry sauce. Eggs can be hard-boiled and eaten plain, sliced on salads or over soup or rice, or mixed with mayo, mustard, and spices (paprika, cayenne, pepper) for egg salad. 
  - Canned fish is another good source of protein and healthy fats, although weekly intake should be limited depending on the type due to concerns about mercury content. Sardines and anchovies are some of the safest from this standpoint as they are smaller fish, and so have less opportunity to accumulate heavy metal pollution from other points in the food chain. They can be added straight on toast with a little vinegar. Tinned sardines and mayonnaise can be used to make a hearty dip for crackers. 
  - Longlife (also known as ultra-pasteurized or ultra heat treated) milk. Vegan milks also tend to be longlife, but dairy milk offers more complete nutrition. 

- **Other shelf-stable flavorings, fats, and comfort foods**. If you don't already, it's a good idea to have some vinegar (balsalmic, red wine), miso paste, soy/tamari sauce, and other basic spices (iodized salt, pepper, paprika, cayenne, thyme, oregano, basil, cinnamon, sugar / sweetener of your choice) to experiment with cooking differently during this different time. Fats other than butter tend to already be shelf-stable -- olive oil is a common favorite for its heart-healthy properties as well as its taste. While now is not a time to binge on ultra-processed foods, nor is it a time to push yourself to give up that cup of coffee or bite of chocolate that makes you happy. If you can hide away a jar of cherry preserves, Nutella, or whatever else your weakness is -- for "emergencies" -- there's nothing like gooey gourmet toast to soothe whatever ails you that can be treated without professional medical assistance.

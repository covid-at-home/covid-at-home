## Shopping list

Here are some necessary and handy things to have if you are going to be taking care of someone with COVID-19. None of this is very expensive. If we included examples (generally on the German version of Amazon), this is not a buying recommendation and we are not making any money if you click that precise one (or any other). By showing you the example, we mean nothing more than *"something like this"*. Use whatever online or retail channel you like to get something similar. 

&nbsp;

### Must have

* **Fever thermometer** (2-10 EUR/USD) ([example](https://www.amazon.de/gp/product/B001NYHXYS))

   > ![](/images/thermometer.png)
   > 
   > So important that you should probably check yours if it's been in the bathroom cabinet for ages. Is the battery still OK? It really doesn't hurt to have two, just in case. At 2-10 bucks, they make great gifts (and as they may be inserted anally to get a more precise measurement, they may not be items you want to loan to someone.)

* **Enough sheets, pillow casings, towels**
   
   > Stuff most everyone has in the home, but just to be sure: Once people get sick, you want to change the bed linens often, and you may use more towels also.
   
* **Cleaning supplies, bleach**

* **Paracetamol (also known as acetaminophen)**

  > The fever supressant and painkiller of choice. Make sure you follow the packaging instructions and do not exceed the maximum recommended daily dose.

### PPE (Personal Protective Equipment)

Shopping for PPE is a little tricky for several reasons.

First of all you may not be familiar with what kinds of protection are needed in what situations. Also it is surprisingly hard to make sure your mask has a proper fit. Make sure you watch some YouTube videos on how to safely put on, use and dispose of your PPE to make sure it really works to protect you and others.

Then there's the fact that some people have been panic-buying and some companies have been price-gouging, making essential equipment like masks unavailable in some places even to doctors and nurses who really need them. If it's still early in the pandemic, your government may be providing masks to people who live with and/or care for people with COVID-19. The section here describes things that you could try to get if you need to be caring for other people. Please listen to official advice on what **not** to buy so as to not make things unavailable to the doctors and nurses who need them the most. 

When it comes right down to it you'll have to make your own choices as to the level of protection that is appropriate in your situation.

* **Medical mask, preferably N95** (a few EUR/USD) ([example](https://www.amazon.de/dp/B0856T8DC2))
   > ![](/images/mask.png)
   > 
   > FFP2 or FFP3 respirators (valved or non-valved versions) are also recommended. A regular face mask (surgical or procedural) is better than nothing if you cannot get a respirator.

* **Gown / raincoat** (a few EUR/USD) ([example](https://www.amazon.de/dp/B07DFDFFRX))

   > Best is if you can find a long-sleeved, water-resistant gown. 

* **Gloves** (less than a EUR/USD) ([example](https://www.amazon.de/dp/B01LWJ80C7))
   > ![](/images/gloves.png)

* **Eye protection, goggles or face shield** (a few EUR/USD) ([example](https://www.amazon.de/dp/B002THV25Y))
   > ![](/images/glasses.png)

### Nice to have

* **Pulse oxymeter** (20-25 EUR/USD) ([example](https://www.amazon.de/gp/product/B07P3ZS6L3))
   > ![](/images/pulse-oxi.png)
   >
   > Little gadget that clips on your finger and shows the heart rate (which is also easy to measure in other ways) and the oxygen saturation in the blood (which is hard to measure any other way).

* **Blood pressure meter** (20 EUR/USD or so) ([example](https://www.amazon.de/gp/product/B07KY867ZH))
   > ![](/images/blood-pressure.png)
   > 
   > There are simple tricks to see if someone's blood pressure is getting too low (see the main text on this site). However, it doesn't hurt to be able to measure this more objectively, especially if you want to see/show a trend in the patient's blood pressure.

* **Incontinence / waterproof sheets** (20 EUR/USD or so) ([example](https://www.amazon.de/Comfortcare-Inkontinenz-Bettw%C3%A4sche-waschbar-Blau/dp/B07W7CCQVG) or [example](https://www.amazon.de/Co-operative-Independent-Living-Bettdeckenbezug-wasserabweisend/dp/B00BJMA8X2))
   > ![](/images/sheet.png)
   >
   > Sick people sometimes have accidents. You'll thank us.

* **Steam inhaler** (25 EUR/USD or so) ([example](https://www.amazon.de/gp/product/B07SNQH6CZ))
   > ![](/images/steam.png)
   >
   > Often sold as "face sauna" or whatever other names, they're just devices that output steam that is not too hot to breathe. Any other method that produces steam is also OK, just make sure you don't do damage with steam that's too hot. The device takes demineralized water ([example](https://www.amazon.de/gp/product/B07J5Y95MQ)), esp. in places where the tapwater is high in calcium. 

* **Vitamins** (a few EUR/USD) ([example](https://www.amazon.de/dp/B07S63PCZK))
   > ![](/images/multi-vitamin.png)
   >
   > For when the patient doesn't eat (much) anymore but still drinks. Maybe take the big multi-vitamin pills that fizz into water, a couple of tubes of those. Try getting ones that contain roughly 1-2 times the daily recommended dose of all the vitamins and minerals they contain, no crazy 1000% megadoses.
